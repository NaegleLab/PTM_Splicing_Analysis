# Code Used for Analysis of the Relationship between PTMs and Alternative Splicing
This repository contains all code used to generate the data and figures used in our manuscript, which you can find here: [](). We provide the code as two types, either data analysis or figure generation. All data used in the figure generation code comes from the data analysis code. All data used in the manuscript can also be found at the following figshare: []().

The code used to project PTMs onto alternative transcripts can be found in a separate repository ([]()) and is freely available for use.
